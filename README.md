# linkedList
### Simple linked list with a few methods. To String method, get size, pop, append, prepend, find, and contains. I could have added a third hashset to make find more efficient, but it is what it is.

# Hashtable
### Simple hash table with a few methods. Get, Set, Remove, has, length, clear, keys, values, entries, and a (should be private) method to redistribute the entries when increasing the number of buckets.

# Binary Search Tree
### A simple BST class + Node class, with some useful functions to insert, delete, search, perform callbacks, traverse, check if the tree is balanced, find height, depth, build, and rebalance the tree.

# Knights
### A small BFS to find the shortest path between two spaces on a board as a knight.
